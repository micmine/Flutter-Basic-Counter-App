# Flutter Basic Counter App
This app is compatible with every Device that's compatible with [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).
It has two counters as default but you can add more by your self when setting up flutter on a pc.

## Add more counters
Just go to the CounterListView.dart and add in line 17 a new counter with :

```
_buildCounter(2, "Another counter", Colors.yellow),
```

Please increment the first integer so that it works.

## Why I made this
I wanted to learn flutter to my skillset this was just a project for my self.

## Get Started
Setup flutter development [here](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install)
Then Download the code from GitHub and open it with your chosen IDE.
